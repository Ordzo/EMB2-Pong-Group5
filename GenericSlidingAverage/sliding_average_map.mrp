  Number of Slice LUTs:                        122 out of  27,288    1%
    Number used as logic:                      119 out of  27,288    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             111
      Number using O5 output only:               6
      Number using O5 and O6:                    2
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   6,408    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      3
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         3
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       144 out of  13,644    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          300
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            18 out of     300    6%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 178 out of     300   59%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         104 out of     300   34%
    Number of unique control sets:               3
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               6 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        24 out of     316    7%
    IOB Flip Flops:                             20
