WARNING:Timing:3159 - The DCM, DCM_CLKGEN_inst, has the attribute DFS_OSCILLATOR_MODE not set to PHASE_FREQ_LOCK. No phase relationship
   exists between the input clock and CLKFX or CLKFX180 outputs of this DCM. Data paths between these clock domains must be constrained
   using FROM/TO constraints.
